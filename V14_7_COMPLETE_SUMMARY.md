# Version 14.7 - Complete Summary

**Date:** October 28-29, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Both batch processor and iPad app deployed

## Overview

Version 14.7 introduces a comprehensive manual review workflow with automatic flagging, enhanced logging, and streamlined UI for quick finalization. The batch processor and iPad app now work in perfect harmony.

---

## Part 1: Batch Processor v14.7 (Oct 28-29)

### Changes

#### 1. ✅ Disabled Auto-Finalization
- Set `auto_finalize: false` in batch-config.yaml
- References remain unfinalized after processing
- Appear at top of iPad app main window for review
- User maintains full control over finalization

#### 2. ✅ MANUAL_REVIEW Flag System
- Automatically flags references with no suitable URLs
- Logic: No primary URL with score ≥75 → `FLAGS[MANUAL_REVIEW]`
- Format: `[110] Title... FLAGS[MANUAL_REVIEW]`
- Helps identify references needing manual research

#### 3. ✅ Enhanced Batch Logging
- Detailed recommendations with space for user notes
- Format includes:
  - Batch processor recommendations (PRIMARY/SECONDARY with scores and AI reasoning)
  - User review notes section (to fill in after iPad review)
  - Clear separation between AI suggestions and user decisions

#### 4. ✅ Critical Parser Bug Fixed
- **Issue:** Relevance text truncating at first capital 'F'
- **Cause:** Regex pattern `[^F]*?` stopped at any 'F'
- **Fix:** Changed to `.+?` to capture full text
- **Impact:** All relevance text now preserved correctly

### Files Modified
- `batch-config.yaml` - Disabled auto_finalize
- `batch-processor.js` - MANUAL_REVIEW flag logic, enhanced logging
- `batch-utils.js` - Fixed relevance regex, MANUAL_REVIEW parsing/writing

### Test Results (RID 109-123)
- **Performance:** 7m 53s (~32 seconds per reference)
- **Cost:** ~$1.80 (120 Google searches + Claude API)
- **Success Rate:** 12/15 references found URLs (80%)
- **High Scores:** 9 references with P:95+ or P:100
- **Manual Review:** 3 references flagged (110, 112, 114)

---

## Part 2: iPad App v14.7 (Oct 29)

### Changes

#### 1. ✅ Quick Finalize Button
- Added "Finalize" button to reference panels in main window
- Only shows when reference is unfinalized AND has primary URL
- One-click finalization without opening Edit modal
- Perfect for approving excellent batch recommendations

**Example:**
```
RID 115 - Batch found P:100, S:90
Old: Edit → Review → Finalize → Close (4 clicks, 10 seconds)
New: Finalize (1 click, 2 seconds)
```

#### 2. ✅ Removed Redundant Buttons
- Removed "Primary URL" and "Secondary URL" buttons from reference panels
- URLs are already clickable links above the buttons
- Cleaner, less cluttered UI
- Still full access to URLs via clickable links

#### 3. ✅ Auto-Clear MANUAL_REVIEW Flag
- When user finalizes reference, `FLAGS[MANUAL_REVIEW]` automatically removed
- Logic: Finalization = approval, MANUAL_REVIEW = needs attention
- Prevents conflicting flags in decisions.txt
- Clear status tracking

#### 4. ✅ Enhanced finalizeReference() Function
- Now accepts optional `refId` parameter
- **From Edit Modal:** Updates fields from form, then finalizes
- **From Main Window:** Validates URLs exist, finalizes as-is
- Dual-mode operation enables quick finalization

### Files Modified
- `index.html` - Lines 10, 1049 (version bump), 2207 (UI buttons), 2384-2451 (finalize function)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated with v14.7 documentation
- `TODO_IPAD_APP_V14_7.md` - Marked as completed

### Code Changes Summary

|----------|--------|---------|
| index.html:10 | Version → v14.7 | Title update |
| index.html:1049 | Version → v14.7 | Header update |

## Complete Workflow (Batch + iPad)

### Step 1: Batch Processing
```bash
cd ~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Fergi/AI\ Wrangling/References/
node batch-processor.js
```

**Output:**
- References with URLs → Left unfinalized (no flags)
- References without URLs → Flagged with `FLAGS[MANUAL_REVIEW]`
- Detailed log with AI recommendations and user review sections

### Step 2: iPad Review
1. Open iPad app → Reconnect to Dropbox
2. Unfinalized references appear at top of main window
3. Review each reference:
   - **Good recommendations:** Click "Finalize" button directly
   - **Need changes:** Click "Edit" → Modify → Finalize
   - **Flagged for manual review:** Research and add URLs manually

### Step 3: Documentation
- Fill in "User Review Notes" section in batch log
- Document any URL changes or overrides
- Track patterns for future improvements

   - Goal: <25% (currently tracking)

2. **Flag Accuracy:** Are MANUAL_REVIEW flags correct?
   - Test result: 3/15 references flagged (20%)

3. **Score Correlation:** Do high-scoring URLs get accepted?
   - Test result: 9/15 with P:95+ (60% excellent results)

4. **Time Savings:** Average time per reference
   - Batch: ~32 seconds (automated)
   - Quick finalize: ~2 seconds (manual approval)
