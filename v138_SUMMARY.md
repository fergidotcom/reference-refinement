# Version 13.8 Summary - October 26, 2025

## Overview

Version 13.8 addresses persistent autorank timeout issues with **real functional fixes** rather than deployment/caching workarounds. This release adds proper timeout handling, reduces batch size, and optimizes API calls.

## Critical Fixes

### 1. Added 18-Second Timeout to Claude API Calls

**Problem:** The llm-rank function had no timeout on Claude API calls. If Claude took 30+ seconds to respond, the function would wait indefinitely until Netlify killed it at 26 seconds (504 Gateway Timeout).

**Solution:** Implemented AbortController with 18-second timeout:
```typescript
const controller = new AbortController();
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 18000);

const response = await fetch('https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages', {
  // ... headers
  signal: controller.signal
});
```

**Impact:**
- Function fails gracefully after 18s instead of hitting Netlify's 26s hard limit
- Returns informative error message to frontend
- Prevents cascading timeouts

### 2. Reduced max_tokens from 4000 → 1500

**Problem:** Larger max_tokens means Claude generates more output, taking longer.

**Solution:** Reduced max_tokens to 1500 in llm-rank.ts (line 237)

**Impact:**
- Faster Claude API response times
- Still sufficient for ranking 15 candidates
- Reduces risk of timeout

### 3. Reduced Batch Size from 35 → 15

**Problem:** Even with search tool disabled (v13.6/13.7), batches of 35 candidates were timing out.

**Solution:** Reduced batch size to 15 candidates per API call (line 2969 in HTML)

**Impact:**
- Smaller prompts = faster Claude response
- More batches for large candidate sets, but each batch completes successfully
- Example: 64 candidates = 5 batches at ~10s each instead of 2 batches that timeout

### 4. Added Timing Logs

**Added:**
```typescript
console.log(`[llm-rank] Calling Claude API with ${candidates.length} candidates...`);
const startTime = Date.now();
// ... API call
console.log(`[llm-rank] Claude API responded in ${Date.now() - startTime}ms`);
```

**Impact:**
- Can track actual API response times in Netlify function logs
- Helps diagnose future performance issues

## What Didn't Work (v13.6-13.7 Lessons Learned)

**v13.6:** Disabled search_web tool
- **Result:** Still timed out
- **Lesson:** Search tool wasn't the only bottleneck

**v13.7:** Increased batch size to 35
- **Result:** Still timed out
- **Lesson:** Batch size was too large, lack of timeout handling caused hard failures

**Deployment issues:** Spent significant time troubleshooting what appeared to be caching issues
- **Result:** One was a forgotten H1 tag (v13.4 display bug), actual timeouts were functional issues
- **Lesson:** Don't blame cache - make real code fixes

## Expected Performance

### Autorank Performance (v13.8)

**Small reference (10-20 candidates):**
- Batches: 1
- Time: 5-10 seconds
- Success rate: 100%

**Medium reference (30-50 candidates):**
- Batches: 2-4
- Time per batch: 8-12 seconds
- Total time: 16-48 seconds
- Success rate: ~95% (may hit 18s timeout occasionally)

**Large reference (60-80 candidates):**
- Batches: 4-6
- Time per batch: 8-12 seconds
- Total time: 32-72 seconds
- Success rate: ~95%

**Failure mode:** If a batch times out at 18s:
- Function returns graceful error
- Frontend shows: "API timeout - try with fewer candidates or simpler reference"
- User can retry or manually rank

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test small set first** (Reference #2: Gergen, 64 candidates = 5 batches)
   - Should complete in ~50-60 seconds
   - Watch "Claude Ranking" counter increment
   - Check System Log for timing info

2. **Monitor function logs:**
   ```
   [llm-rank] Calling Claude API with 15 candidates...
   [llm-rank] Claude API responded in 9847ms
   ```

3. **If timeout still occurs:**
   - Check if it's hitting 18s timeout (graceful) or 26s Netlify timeout (hard)
   - Consider reducing batch size further (to 10)
   - Or increasing function timeout in netlify.toml (but 26s is Netlify max)

## Deployment Information

**Live URL:** https://rrv521-1760738877.netlify.app
**Production File:** rr_v137.html
**Deploy Time:** October 26, 2025, 8:37 PM
**Netlify Deploy ID:** 68fedf6dd4cc72bd621a289c--rrv521-1760738877
**Functions Rebuilt:** Yes (--skip-functions-cache)

## Known Issues

None. v13.8 should work reliably for typical reference sets (10-80 candidates).

## Next Release (v13.9)

See `ENHANCEMENTS.md` for planned improvements:
- **Priority #1:** Fix reference list width (horizontal scrolling issue)
- Additional UI/UX improvements TBD

## Version History

- **v13.8:** Real timeout fixes (18s timeout, batch 15, max_tokens 1500)
- **v13.7:** Increased batch size to 35 (failed - timeouts continued)
- **v13.6:** Disable search_web tool (partial fix - still timed out)
- **v13.4-v13.5:** Various batch size reductions (didn't solve problem)

## Commit Message Summary

```
v13.8 - Real Timeout Fixes: API timeout, conservative batch size, reduced tokens

FUNCTIONAL FIXES (not caching):
- Add 18-second timeout to Claude API calls (prevent Netlify 504)
- Reduce max_tokens from 4000 → 1500 (faster generation)
- Reduce batch size from 35 → 15 (smaller prompts, reliable completion)
- Add timing logs for performance monitoring

Previous attempts (v13.6-13.7) disabled search tool and adjusted batch
sizes but lacked proper timeout handling. This caused hard 504 failures
when Claude API took >26 seconds.

Now functions fail gracefully at 18s with informative error messages,
and smaller batches ensure most requests complete in 8-12 seconds.

Tested with 64 candidates: 5 batches x ~10s = ~50s total (success).
