**Version:** v16.1 (Enhanced Query Prompts)
**References Processed:** 9
**Duration:** 4m 33s
**Cost:** ~$1.08

---

## üéØ OBJECTIVE

Re-process 9 unfinalized references from the v16.0 batch using the ENHANCED query generation prompts that match the iPad app.

---

## üîß WHAT CHANGED IN V16.1

### Enhanced Query Generation Prompt

**Added to batch-processor.js (lines 498-509):**

```javascript
QUERY BEST PRACTICES:
‚úì Use exact title in quotes for primary and review queries
‚úì Keep queries 40-80 characters (max 120)
‚úì Use 1-2 quoted phrases per query max
‚úì Prioritize free sources over paywalled

AVOID:
‚ùå URLs or domain names in queries (except site: operator)
‚ùå Overly specific jargon combinations
‚ùå ISBN + publisher + full title together (too specific)
```

This guidance helps Claude generate better-quality search queries that:
- Are the right length (not too long or too short)
- Use appropriate quoting (not over-quoted)
- Avoid over-specification that finds nothing

## üéØ KEY INSIGHTS

### Why Enhanced Prompts Work

1. **Length Constraints** prevent over-specification
   - Queries stay focused and findable
   - Not too broad, not too narrow

   - 1-2 quoted phrases maximum
   - Allows some flexibility in results

3. **Explicit Avoidance Rules** prevent common mistakes
   - No ISBN + publisher + full title combinations
   - No overly specific jargon strings

### Evidence of Better Queries

The improvements show enhanced prompts help find:
- ‚úÖ Secondary sources that were completely missed (REF 120)
- ‚úÖ Better scholarly articles (REF 122, 203)
- ‚úÖ More accurate relevance scoring (REF 121, 124, 201)
- ‚úÖ Alternative Archive.org URLs (REF 202)

## üìâ WHAT DIDN'T IMPROVE

### REF [126] - Radio 1930s
- Same result (P:95, no secondary)
- Likely because it's a podcast episode with limited scholarly discussion

### REF [127] - Philo Farnsworth
- Still flagged for manual review
- Difficult topic with scarce online sources
- **Expected** - Not a failure of the enhanced prompts
