# Session Summary - October 27, 2025

**Session Focus:** Analyze logs, implement v14.2 enhancements
**Duration:** Continued from previous session (context limit reached)
**Status:** ✅ All tasks completed successfully

---

## Tasks Completed

### 1. ✅ Log Analysis
- Reviewed system logs from today's testing sessions
- Identified issues from v14.1 testing (50% override rate)
- User feedback: "Surely sonnet can do this well if it has a big enough bite of each candidate site to analyze. Do better."

### 2. ✅ v14.2 Design
- Created comprehensive design document: `V14_2_DESIGN.md`
- Three main features:
  1. Query allocation control (user-configurable primary/secondary split)
  2. Enhanced cost tracking (real-time display + projections)
  3. Improved detection (language + review website detection)

### 3. ✅ v14.2 Implementation

#### Backend Changes:
**File:** `netlify/functions/llm-rank.ts`
- Added language detection rules (non-English domains → max P:70)
- Added review website detection rules (complete-review.com, goodreads.com → max S:60)
- Enhanced secondary scoring to distinguish scholarly reviews from review websites

#### Frontend Changes:
**File:** `index.html`
- **Query Allocation UI:**
  - Added dropdown controls for primary/secondary query split
  - Added preset buttons (4+4, 6+2, 2+6)
  - Modified query generation to use dynamic allocation

- **Cost Tracking:**
  - Created `addCostSummaryPanel()` function
  - Added cost info to query generation debug panel
  - Added cost info to autorank debug panel
  - Displays: tokens, cost per operation, session totals, projections

- **Version Update:**
  - Updated `<title>` to v14.2
  - Updated `<h1>` to v14.2

### 4. ✅ Deployment
- Deployed v14.2 to production via Netlify
- **Production URL:** https://rrv521-1760738877.netlify.app
- **Unique Deploy:** https://690035ba88d2cbbf658e4e1d--rrv521-1760738877.netlify.app
- Deploy completed successfully at ~9:00 PM PST

### 5. ✅ Documentation Updates
- **LOG_ANALYSIS_TRACKER.md** - Marked v14.2 action items as completed
- **CLAUDE.md** - Updated to current version v14.2 with feature descriptions
- **V14_2_DESIGN.md** - Updated status to "IMPLEMENTED"
- **V14_2_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Created comprehensive implementation summary
- **API_COST_TRACKER.md** - Added note about v14.2 real-time tracking
- **SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-10-27.md** - This file

## Key Improvements in v14.2

### Query Allocation Control
Users can now experiment with different query allocations:
- **4+4** (balanced) - default behavior
- **6+2** (primary focus) - more queries for full-text sources
- **2+6** (secondary focus) - more queries for reviews
- **Custom** - any combination totaling 8 queries

**Purpose:** Find optimal query balance for different reference types

### Enhanced Cost Tracking
Real-time visibility into API costs:
- Per-operation costs with token breakdown
- Session cumulative totals
- Average cost per reference
- Projections for batch runs (100/500 references)

**Purpose:** Monitor spending and project costs for batch processing

### Improved Detection
Two new detection rules:
1. **Language Detection:** Non-English domains capped at P:70
   - Prevents books.google.li (German) from scoring too high
2. **Review Website Detection:** Aggregator sites capped at S:60
   - Distinguishes complete-review.com from scholarly journal reviews

**Purpose:** Reduce override rate from 50% (v14.1) to <25% (v14.2 goal)

---

## Test Results Progression

| Version | Override Rate | Key Issues |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| **v14.0** | 100% (4/4) | Couldn't distinguish books from reviews |
| **v14.1** | 50% (2/4) | Review websites vs scholarly reviews, language detection |
| **v14.2** | TBD | Enhanced detection rules implemented |

**Goal:** <25% override rate with v14.2

## Cost Analysis (User-Reported)

**Current Totals (as of Oct 27, ~8:30 PM):**
- Claude API: $4.16
- Google API: $84.39
- **Combined: $88.55**

**Estimated Usage:**
- ~16,878 Google searches
- ~2,110 references processed
- ~$0.042 per reference

**Projection for Next 500 References:**
- Google: ~$20.00
- Claude: ~$10.50
- **Total: ~$30.50**

**Estimated New Total:** ~$119.05

## Next Steps (For User)

### Immediate Testing:
1. **Test Query Allocation:**
   - Try 6+2 split (primary focus)
   - Try 2+6 split (secondary focus)
   - Compare results quality

2. **Verify Cost Tracking:**
   - Check Debug tab for cost panels
   - Verify projections are reasonable
   - Compare with historical averages

3. **Retest Problem References:**
   - Reference #8 (Hacking) - verify complete-review.com scores lower
   - Reference #100 (Zarefsky) - verify books.google.li scores lower

### Monitor Override Rate:
- Process additional references
- Track overrides in session logs
- Goal: Achieve <25% override rate
- If not reached, plan v14.3 with additional improvements

### Batch Run Preparation:
- Once override rate is acceptable (<25%)
- Use cost projections to budget for batch processing
- Consider optimal query allocation based on testing
