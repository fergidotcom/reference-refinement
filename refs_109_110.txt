[109] Amnesty International (2022). The Social Atrocity: Meta and the Right to Remedy for the Rohingya. Amnesty International, London, UK. Document Reference: ASA 16/5933/2022. Relevance: Amnesty International's work is pivotal in elucidating the complex interplay between social media platforms, specifically Facebook, and the propagation of hate speech, particularly in the context of genocide. This manuscript employs Amnesty's findings to critically analyze how Facebook's algorithms, designed to maximize user engagement, inadvertently facilitated the coordination of violent attacks against the Rohingya population in 2017. By highlighting the stark contrast between the platform's operational priorities and the ethical implications of its content moderation policies, the manuscript underscores a systemic failure where the removal of harmful content is counterintuitive to the company's revenue model. The reference to Amnesty International serves to reinforce the argument that what are often perceived as technical shortcomings are, in fact, deliberate features of a profit-driven system that prioritizes attention over human rights. This analysis not only sheds light on the role of social media in modern conflicts but also calls for a reevaluation of accountability measures for tech companies in the face of their profound societal impacts.
