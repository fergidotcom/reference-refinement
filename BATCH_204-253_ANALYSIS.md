## üåü Notable Highlights

### Exceptional Finds
1. **REF 208 (Cognition in the Wild)** - P:100 full PDF + S:95 ResearchGate review
2. **REF 213 (Surveillance Capitalism)** - P:100 full PDF + S:95 Antipode review
3. **REF 217 (Platform Society)** - P:100 Academia.edu + S:95 LSE review

## üîÑ Comparison to Previous Batches

### v16.1 Performance (RIDs 204-253)
- **Primary Coverage:** 78% (25/32)
- **Secondary Coverage:** 66% (21/32)
- **Manual Review Rate:** 22% (7/32)
- **Perfect Scores:** 31% (10/32)

### Previous v16.1 Performance (RIDs 120-127, 201-203)
- **Primary Coverage:** 89% (8/9)
- **Secondary Coverage:** 67% (6/9)
- **Manual Review Rate:** 11% (1/9)

### Observation
Current batch has slightly lower success rate (78% vs 89%) due to:
1. More challenging reference types (statistics, events)
2. Classic texts that are commonly paywalled
3. Niche topics with limited online presence

However, quality remains excellent for successful matches (31% perfect scores).

## üí° Insights & Recommendations

### What Worked Well
‚úÖ **Enhanced v16.1 query prompts** - Consistently found free, high-quality sources
‚úÖ **Academic paper discovery** - Excellent coverage of scholarly literature
‚úÖ **Multiple P:100 scores** - 10 perfect scores demonstrates strong search/ranking
‚úÖ **Secondary coverage** - 66% is solid, many high-quality (S:90-95)

### Areas for Improvement
‚ö†Ô∏è **Statistical/data references** - May need specialized queries or manual research
‚ö†Ô∏è **Event-specific content** - Interviews, speeches need different search strategies
‚ö†Ô∏è **Classic texts** - Consider adding specific sources (Project Gutenberg, etc.)

### Next Steps
1. **Manual research** the 7 flagged references
2. **Review** the 25 successful refs for any needed overrides
3. **Continue** batch processing with v16.1 (proven effective)
4. **Consider** special handling for statistical/event-specific refs
