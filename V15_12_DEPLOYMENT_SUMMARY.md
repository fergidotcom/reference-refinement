# Reference Refinement v15.12 - Deployment Summary
**Date:** October 31, 2025, 5:18 AM
**Status:** ‚úÖ DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION
**Session Duration:** ~2 hours (while you slept)

---

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Successfully implemented **all 7 fixes** from the comprehensive issue analysis, deployed v15.12 to production, and ran batch processor on RIDs 114-133. The new ranking logic is now live on both iPad app and batch processor.

**Key Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ All 7 fixes implemented (P0, P1, P2 priorities)
- ‚úÖ v15.12 deployed to production (iPad app live)
- ‚úÖ Batch processor successfully processed 4 references with new logic
- ‚úÖ Production data backed up before batch run
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 10 references encountered query generation issue (needs investigation)

---

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### P0 - Critical (COMPLETED)

**Fix 1: Better Error Logging** (`index.html` lines 3552-3575)
- **What changed:** Enhanced error handling to distinguish network vs timeout vs parse errors
- **Before:** Generic "Ranking failed" message
- **After:** Specific messages:
  - Network error: "Network error during ranking. Check connection and retry."
  - Timeout: "Ranking timeout. Try with fewer candidates or simpler queries."
  - Other: "Ranking failed. Check Debug tab (Tab 3) for details."
- **Debug output:** Shows error type, message, and stack trace (first 500 chars)
- **Benefit:** Easier to diagnose RID 115-type failures

---

### P1 - High Priority (COMPLETED)

**Fix 2: Quotations/Excerpts Detection** (`llm-rank.ts` lines 138-143)
```
QUOTATIONS/EXCERPTS/ANTHOLOGIES (max 65):
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: If title or URL contains "quotations", "excerpts", "anthology",
"selections", "reader" ‚Üí MAX SCORE 65
‚ö†Ô∏è These are PARTIAL collections, not complete works
‚ö†Ô∏è Example: "Peter Berger Quotations" ‚â† Full text of Berger's work
```
- **Fixes:** RID 3 issue (quotations selected instead of full text)
- **Impact:** Prevents partial content from scoring higher than full text

**Fix 3: News About Research Detection** (`llm-rank.ts` lines 160-166)
```
NEWS ABOUT RESEARCH (max 55):
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: If news.mit.edu, sciencedaily.com, phys.org, university press release
‚ö†Ô∏è If snippet contains "study shows", "researchers found", "according to research"
‚ö†Ô∏è These are NEWS REPORTS about research, not the research itself
‚ö†Ô∏è PRIMARY score: max 55 (this is coverage, not the source)
```
- **Fixes:** RID 114 issue (MIT news article vs Science journal)
- **Impact:** Press releases no longer compete with actual journal articles

**Fix 4: Adjusted Secondary Scoring** (`llm-rank.ts` lines 204-222)
```
BEFORE:
- Academic discussion: 60-75
- Topic discussion: 40-60

AFTER:
- Academic discussion: 75-90  ‚Üê INCREASED
- Topic discussion: 60-75      ‚Üê INCREASED
```
- **Fixes:** RID 106, 111 issues (poor secondary selection when no reviews)
- **User insight:** "Two-tier scoring like primaries" - reviews 90-100, analysis 75-90
- **Impact:** Better secondary recommendations when no reviews exist

**Fix 5: Improved Query Generation** (`index.html` lines 2733-2736)
```
BEFORE (Query 8):
"social media political polarization disinformation"  ‚Üê keyword string

AFTER (Query 8):
"scholarly analysis of [key concepts]" OR
"empirical research on [key concepts]" OR
"theoretical frameworks for [key concepts]"  ‚Üê proper phrases
Add qualifiers: "peer-reviewed", "academic discussion", "research perspectives"
```
- **Fixes:** RID 111 issue (keyword strings instead of phrases)
- **Impact:** Better query quality = better secondary candidates

---

### P2 - Medium Priority (COMPLETED)

**Fix 6: Parser Title Extraction** (`index.html` lines 1957-2013)
- **Enhanced edition detection:** Now catches 4 patterns:
  1. `(2nd ed.)` or `(Revised)` - parenthesized
  2. `2nd ed` or `2nd Edition` - plain numbered
  3. `Updated Edition`, `Revised Edition` - plain text
  4. `(Rev.)` or `Revised` - short forms
- **Fixes:** RID 102, 104 issues (bibliography in title field)
- **Behavior:** Edition markers and everything after moved to "other" field
- **Impact:** Cleaner titles, better search matching

**Fix 7: Manual Review Flag** (`index.html` lines 3420-3447)
```
BEFORE:
- Threshold: 60 (too low)
- No debug logging

AFTER:
- Threshold: 75 (matches user expectations)
- Enhanced debug logging when flagged
- Shows specific reasons (primary score, secondary score)
```
- **Fixes:** RID 111 issue (no flag when secondary missing)
- **Impact:** References needing attention are properly flagged

---

**‚ùå Failed to Process: 10 references (RIDs 118-127)**

**Error:** `HTTP 400: {"error":"Missing query parameter"}`

**Affected References:**
- [118] Post-Broadcast Democracy...
- [119] Comparing Media Systems...
- [120] News Coverage of the 2016 General Election...
- [121] Media and Political Polarization
- [122] Democratic Eloquence...
- [123] Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man
- [124] A New Beginning...
- [125] October 7) News Corporation...
- [126] November 10) Radio: The Internet of the 1930s
- [127] September) Philo Farnsworth...

**Analysis:**
- All failed references only generated **1 query** instead of 8
- Batch processor log shows: "‚úì Generated 1 queries" (should be 8)
- Likely an issue with query generation API for these specific references
- Could be related to:
  - Title format (some start with dates like "October 7)", "November 10)")
  - Title length
  - Special characters
  - Relevance text issues

**Recommendation:**
- Process these manually in iPad app to see if query generation works
- If it fails in app too, investigate query generation prompt
- May need to add error handling for malformed query responses

## üîç NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (When You Wake Up)

1. **Test v15.12 on iPad**
   - Open https://rrv521-1760738877.netlify.app
   - Verify header shows "v15.12"
   - Load decisions.txt (should show 288 refs)
   - Check RIDs 114-117 to see new URLs

2. **Review Batch Results**
   - **RID 114:** Verify primary/secondary URLs are correct
   - **RID 115:** Check if primary URL is good (no secondary found)
   - **RID 116:** Verify both URLs
   - **RID 117:** Manually search for URLs (flagged for review)

3. **Investigate Failed References (RIDs 118-127)**
   - Try processing RID 118 manually in iPad app
   - Does query generation work in the app?
   - If yes: Batch processor bug
   - If no: Query generation bug affecting both

### Short-term (Next Session)

4. **Fix Batch Processor Query Issue**
   - Debug why 10 references only generated 1 query
   - Add better error handling for malformed API responses
   - Possibly related to new query generation prompt in Fix 5

5. **Re-run Failed References**
   - Once batch processor issue fixed
   - Update batch-config.yaml: start: 118, end: 127
   - Re-process the 10 failed references

6. **Quality Check**
   - Review all 14 references from this batch
   - Compare v15.12 recommendations to v15.11
   - Validate the 7 fixes are working as expected
   - Calculate override rate (goal: <25%)

### Long-term (Future Enhancements)

7. **Monitor New Logic Performance**
   - Track override rate with v15.12
   - Watch for quotations false positives
   - Check if news detection is too aggressive
   - Verify secondary scoring produces good results

8. **Consider Additional Improvements**
   - Add retry logic with exponential backoff (from analysis)
   - Implement streaming progress for long operations
   - Add user feedback system for bad recommendations

## üéì LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Error Logging is Critical:** Fix 1 will make future debugging much easier
2. **Two-Tier Scoring Works:** User's insight about primaries applies to secondaries too
3. **Mutual Exclusivity is Important:** News ‚â† research, quotations ‚â† full text
4. **Threshold Matters:** Raising from 60 to 75 aligns with user expectations
5. **Query Quality Matters:** Phrases work better than keyword strings
6. **Batch Processor Needs Better Error Handling:** 10 failures suggest robustness issue

---

## üìû USER ACTION REQUIRED

### High Priority
1. **Test iPad app with v15.12**
2. **Review RIDs 114-117** (batch processed)
3. **Try processing RID 118 manually** (investigate query failure)

### Medium Priority
4. **Finalize RID 114-116** if URLs look good
5. **Search manually for RID 117** (no suitable URLs found)
6. **Decide on batch processor fix approach**

### Low Priority
7. **Calculate new override rate** after using v15.12 for a few days
8. **Consider parser improvements** if edition detection still has issues
