  - **ENHANCEMENT REQUEST:** Query generator should focus:
    - **PRIMARY queries:** 3 out of 4 for full source in any form (PDF preferred, not paywalled)
    - **PRIMARY queries:** 1 out of 4 for publisher page or purchase page
    - **SECONDARY queries:** 3 out of 4 for reviews/analyses of the reference work
    - **SECONDARY queries:** 1 out of 4 for discussions of the reference topic

**‚úÖ session_2025-10-28T02-33-00.txt** (Oct 27, 20:33)
- **References:** #7 (Searle 2010) + #8 (Hacking 1999)
- **Testing:** v14.0 query generation and autorank
- **User Comments:**
  - "Scholarly reviews are best but rank other reviews as well."
  - "Move the message flashes higher in the Edit Reference Window so they don't obscure the Done, Save Changes and Finalize buttons."
- **Overrides:** 4 total (2 primary, 2 secondary)
- **Primary Issues:**
  - Archive.org scored P:95 but wasn't full text
  - UChicago journal PDF scored P:95 but was a review, not the book
- **Secondary Issues:**
  - PhilPapers entries scored S:95 as "review article" but were just bibliography listings
  - Actual reviews (d-nb.info, SAGE) ranked lower
- **Root Cause:** AI judges by URL/domain/snippet, cannot distinguish:
  - Book vs. book review (for primaries)
  - Actual review vs. bibliography listing (for secondaries)
- **Action Items:**
  - [x] v14.1: Enhanced content-type detection in ranking prompt (COMPLETED)
  - [x] v14.1: Move toast messages higher (UI fix) (COMPLETED)
- **Analysis Date:** 2025-10-27
- **Implementation Date:** 2025-10-27 (v14.1 deployed)
- **Full Analysis:** V14_1_ANALYSIS.md

**‚úÖ session_2025-10-28T02-59-26.txt** (Oct 27, 20:59)
- **References:** #8 (Hacking 1999 - retest) + #100 (Zarefsky 1990)
- **Testing:** v14.1 content-type detection
- **Overrides:** 2 total (1 secondary, 1 primary)
- **Results:**
  - Ref #8 Primary: ‚úÖ ACCEPTED (AI correctly identified WordPress PDF as book)
  - Ref #8 Secondary: ‚ùå Override - AI suggested complete-review.com (review site), user wanted SAGE journal review
  - Ref #100 Primary: ‚ùå Override - AI suggested books.google.li (German), user wanted UChicago Press
- **User Comments:**
  - "This is a book review, as it states on the first page. THE SUGGESTED SECONDARY WAS clearly not. Refine the ai analysis in Autorank. This is sonnet doing the analysis. Surely sonnet can do this well if it has a big enough bite of each candidate site to analyze. Do better."
  - "The suggested primary was a German language site."
- **Root Cause:**
  - Review *website* (complete-review.com) scored same as review *article* (SAGE journal)
  - Language detection missing (books.google.li = German content)
- **Override Rate:** 50% (down from 100% in v14.0, but goal is <25%)
- **Action Items:**
  - [x] v14.2: Add query allocation control (user-configurable primary/secondary split) (COMPLETED)
  - [x] v14.2: Enhanced cost tracking in debug log (real-time + projections) (COMPLETED)
  - [x] v14.2: Detect review websites vs review articles (complete-review.com ‚Üí max S:60) (COMPLETED)
  - [x] v14.2: Detect non-English domains (books.google.li ‚Üí max P:70) (COMPLETED)
- **Analysis Date:** 2025-10-27
- **Implementation Date:** 2025-10-27 (v14.2 deployed)
- **Full Design:** V14_2_DESIGN.md
