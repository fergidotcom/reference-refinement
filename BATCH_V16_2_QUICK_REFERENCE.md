## 🛡️ WHAT v16.2 FIXED

- RID 222, RID 248 had "page not found" soft 404s
- Sites returned HTTP 200 but showed error pages

- Only recommends validated URLs

**The Result:**
- ✅ 0 soft 404s in this batch

## ⚠️ KNOWN QUIRKS

1. **Some RIDs don't exist** (e.g., 313, 316, 317, 321)
   - Normal - your dataset has gaps
   - Batch processor skips them automatically

2. **ResearchGate sometimes rate limits** (HTTP 429)
   - Temporary, not critical
   - Processor handles gracefully

3. **Manual review rate is 16%**
   - Higher than ideal but expected
   - Some references are just hard (gray literature, recent reports)

---

## 💡 TIPS FOR EFFICIENT REVIEW

**Speed Run (if you're in a hurry):**
1. Sort by score (high to low)
2. Quick finalize top 20 (likely all good)
3. Flag manual review refs for later
4. Done in 15 minutes

**Thorough Run (recommended):**
1. Start with P:100 and S:90+ (10-15 refs, ~15 mins)
2. Review P:90-99 (15-20 refs, ~20 mins)
3. Check P:75-89 (10-15 refs, ~15 mins)
4. Manual review flagged refs (8 refs, ~30 mins)
5. **Total: ~80 minutes**

**Use Quick Notes:**
- "Override: Found better Archive.org PDF"
- "Excellent - both URLs perfect"
- "Manual search failed, need different strategy"
