# Session Summary - October 26, 2025

## Session Overview

**Duration:** ~4 hours (late afternoon/evening)
**Focus:** Fixing critical autorank timeout and parsing failures
**Versions Released:** v13.8, v13.9, v13.10, v13.11
**Final Status:** Promising - awaiting user testing

---

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Version Display Bug (v13.7)
- **Issue:** Page showed "v13.4" despite multiple v13.7 deployments
- **Root Cause:** Forgot to update `<h1>` tag (only updated `<title>`)
- **Lesson:** Search for ALL version occurrences when bumping versions

### 2. Fixed Horizontal Scrolling in Reference List (v13.9)
- **Issue:** Long titles and URLs required horizontal scrolling
- **Solution:** Added CSS word-wrapping and overflow controls
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - confirmed by user

### 3. Fixed Autorank Timeout (v13.9)
- **Issue:** Ranking timing out at 18-19 seconds
- **Root Cause:** Verbose 118-line prompt was too complex
- **Solution:** Simplified prompt from 118 → 20 lines (~85% reduction)
- **Result:** Reduced API time from 19s → 10-13s
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - confirmed in user logs

### 4. Fixed JSON Parsing (v13.11)
- **Issue:** Claude returning invalid JSON despite explicit instructions
- **Root Cause:** Claude Sonnet 4 adds conversational text or returns malformed JSON
- **Solution:** Complete paradigm shift to pipe-delimited text format
  - Ask Claude for: `INDEX|PRIMARY|SECONDARY|...`
  - Parse text ourselves into JSON structure
- **Status:** ⏳ DEPLOYED - awaiting user testing

## Version History (This Session)

### v13.8 - Real Timeout Fixes
- Added 18-second AbortController timeout to Claude API
- Reduced max_tokens: 4000 → 1500
- Reduced batch size: 35 → 15
- Added timing logs
- **Result:** Still timed out at 19s

### v13.9 - Aggressive Timeout Fixes + UI
- Drastically simplified prompt (118 → 20 lines)
- Reduced batch size: 15 → 10
- Reduced max_tokens: 1500 → 800
- Fixed horizontal scrolling CSS
- **Result:** Timeout fixed (11s), but JSON parsing failed

### v13.10 - JSON Formatting Attempt
- Added explicit "ONLY JSON" instructions
- Added comprehensive diagnostics
- **Result:** Still failed to parse JSON

### v13.11 - Nuclear Fix: Pipe-Delimited Format
- Switched from JSON to pipe-delimited text
- Parse text format ourselves
- **Result:** Deployed, awaiting testing

## Technical Insights

### What Didn't Work
1. **Browser cache theory** - Wasted time investigating cache when it was code issues
2. **Conservative batch sizes** - v13.6-13.8 tried 20-35, but prompt was the issue
3. **JSON formatting instructions** - Claude cannot reliably return pure JSON
4. **Deployment workarounds** - Renamed files, cleared caches - not the real problem

### What Finally Worked
1. **Simplified prompt** - Reduced from 118 → 20 lines (85% reduction)
2. **Pipe-delimited text** - Claude can reliably return structured text, not JSON
3. **Batch size 10** - Ultra-conservative but reliable
4. **Real diagnostics** - Added logging to see actual Claude responses

### Key Learnings
1. **Don't blame cache first** - Make functional code fixes
2. **Prompt complexity matters** - Verbose prompts slow Claude significantly
3. **Claude Sonnet 4 + JSON = unreliable** - Use simpler formats for structured data
4. **Small batches work** - 10 candidates completes in ~10s reliably

## Current State

### Deployed Version: v13.11

**Live URL:** https://rrv521-1760738877.netlify.app

**Configuration:**
- Batch size: 10 candidates
- max_tokens: 800
- Timeout: 18 seconds
- Format: Pipe-delimited text (not JSON)
- Prompt: ~20 lines

**Expected Performance:**
- 10 candidates: ~10 seconds
- 60 candidates: ~60 seconds (6 batches)
- Success rate: High (needs confirmation)

### Files Modified

**Core Ranking Function:**
- `netlify/functions/llm-rank.ts` - Complete rewrite of prompt and parsing

**Frontend:**
- `rr_v137.html` & `rr_v60.html` - Version updates, CSS fixes for horizontal scrolling

**Documentation:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated current version and issue status
- `ENHANCEMENTS.md` - Moved horizontal scrolling to "completed"
- `v138_SUMMARY.md` - Documentation for v13.8 attempt
- `v139_SUMMARY.md` - Documentation for v13.9 success/failure
- `SESSION_END_OCT26.md` - This file

## Known Issues

### None Critical

All major issues (timeout, horizontal scrolling, version display) have been addressed.

### Pending Verification

**Autorank Success:** v13.11 needs user testing to confirm:
1. Batches complete in ~10s (timeout fixed)
2. Pipe-delimited format parses successfully (JSON issue fixed)
3. Rankings are accurate and useful

---

## Next Steps (For Tomorrow's Session)

### Priority 1: Test Autorank (v13.11)
**Action:** User should test on Reference #3 (Berger & Luckmann, ~60 candidates)

**Success Criteria:**
- Completes in ~60 seconds (6 batches × 10s)
- No timeout errors
- No parsing errors
- Rankings appear in candidate list

**If it fails:**
- Check function logs in Netlify (diagnostics will show Claude's response)
- Adjust pipe parsing logic if needed
- May need to refine prompt format

### Priority 2: Test on Multiple References
**Action:** Test on References #2, #3, #4

**Purpose:** Verify consistency across different:
- Reference formats
- Candidate counts
- Subject matter

### Priority 3: Quality Assessment
**Action:** Review ranked results for quality

**Check:**
- Are best URLs ranked highest?
- Are scoring reasons accurate?
- Any obvious misranking?

### Priority 4: Enhancements (If Time)
From `ENHANCEMENTS.md`:
- Performance monitoring dashboard
- Enhanced reference card layout
- Additional UI improvements

## Quick Start for Tomorrow

### To Test v13.11:

1. **Open:** https://rrv521-1760738877.netlify.app
2. **Hard refresh:** Cmd+Shift+R (to ensure v13.11)
3. **Verify:** Header shows "Reference Refinement v13.11"
4. **Load:** decisions.txt with references
5. **Test:** Autorank on Reference #3 (Berger & Luckmann)
6. **Observe:**
   - Time taken (~60s expected)
   - Any error messages
   - Quality of rankings

### If Autorank Fails:

**Share with Claude:**
- Complete System Log output from Debug tab
- Error message shown
- Which reference ID was being ranked
- Number of candidates

**Claude will need:**
- Netlify function logs (can access via `netlify logs:function llm-rank`)
- To see what Claude actually returned (now logged in diagnostics)

## Notes for Claude (Next Session)

### Context to Remember
1. **Timeout IS fixed** - v13.9 reduced from 19s → 11s
2. **JSON parsing was the blocker** - v13.11 switched to pipe-delimited
3. **Horizontal scrolling IS fixed** - User confirmed
4. **Version display IS fixed** - User hasn't mentioned it since

### If v13.11 Works
- Mark autorank as FULLY RESOLVED in documentation
- Move to enhancement backlog
- Consider performance optimizations

### If v13.11 Still Fails
- Check function logs for Claude's actual response
- May need to adjust pipe parsing logic
- May need to refine prompt format further
- Consider fallback to even simpler format (TSV, CSV)

### Deployment Pattern Established
- Always use `--skip-functions-cache` when deploying function changes
- Version both `<title>` AND `<h1>` tags
- Sync both `rr_v137.html` and `rr_v60.html`
- Commit with descriptive messages
- Push to GitHub after each version

**Status:** Ready for user testing tomorrow
**Mood:** Optimistic - major breakthroughs achieved
