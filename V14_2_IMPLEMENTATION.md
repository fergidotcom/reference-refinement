# v14.2 Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ DEPLOYED
**Production URL:** https://rrv521-1760738877.netlify.app

---

## Overview

v14.2 implements three major enhancements based on user requests from session log `session_2025-10-28T02-59-26.txt`:

1. **Query Allocation Control** - Let users experiment with different primary/secondary query splits
2. **Enhanced Cost Tracking** - Real-time cost display with projections
3. **Improved Detection** - Language detection + review website detection

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Query Allocation Control ‚úÖ

**Location:** `index.html` lines 1209-1252 (UI), 1436-1492 (state + functions), 2507-2578 (query generation)

**UI Components:**
- Two dropdown selects (Primary: 0-8, Secondary: 0-8)
- Three preset buttons: "4+4", "6+2", "2+6"
- Auto-adjusts to keep total = 8 queries
- Default: 4 primary + 4 secondary (current behavior)

**Functionality:**
```javascript
queryAllocation: {
    primary: 4,
    secondary: 4
}

updateQueryAllocation(changed) {
    // Auto-adjusts other value to keep total = 8
}

setQueryPreset(preset) {
    // Applies preset allocation
}
```

**Query Generation:**
- Dynamically generates prompt based on allocation settings
- If primary = 6, generates 6 primary-focused queries
- If secondary = 2, generates 2 secondary-focused queries
- Works with any combination that totals 8

### 2. Enhanced Cost Tracking ‚úÖ

**Location:** `index.html` lines 2109-2149 (addCostSummaryPanel function)

**New Function:**
```javascript
addCostSummaryPanel() {
    // Calculates session totals
    // Shows cost per operation
    // Displays average per reference
    // Projects costs for batch runs (100/500 refs)
}
```

**Integration Points:**
1. **After Query Generation** (line 2607):
   - Shows tokens used (input + output)
   - Shows cost for this operation
   - Calls `addCostSummaryPanel()`

2. **After Autorank** (lines 3367-3394):
   - Shows tokens used for ranking
   - Shows cost for this operation
   - Calls `addCostSummaryPanel()`

**Display Format:**
```
üí∞ Session Cost Summary

Google Searches: 16 searches = $0.0800
Claude API:
  Query Generation: 2 calls
  Ranking: 2 calls
  Total Tokens: 25,123 (18,456 in + 6,667 out)
  Cost: $0.1554

Session Total: $0.2354
References Processed: 2
Average Per Reference: $0.1177

Projections (based on session average):
Next 100 references: ~$11.77
Next 500 references: ~$58.85
```

### 3. Improved Detection ‚úÖ

**Location:** `netlify/functions/llm-rank.ts` lines 45-299

**Enhancement A: Language Detection**
```typescript
LANGUAGE MISMATCH (max 70):
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: If URL domain suggests non-English (.de, .fr, .li, .es, etc.) ‚Üí MAX SCORE 70
‚ö†Ô∏è Even if from Google Books or academic source
‚ö†Ô∏è Exception: If snippet clearly shows English text, score normally
‚ö†Ô∏è books.google.li likely German
‚ö†Ô∏è books.google.fr likely French
‚ö†Ô∏è books.google.de likely German

COUNTRY-SPECIFIC DOMAINS:
‚Ä¢ .com, .edu, .org, .gov, .uk ‚Üí Assume English
‚Ä¢ .li, .de, .fr, .es, .it, .jp, .cn ‚Üí Likely not English
‚Ä¢ Check snippet for language indicators
```

**Enhancement B: Review Website Detection**
```typescript
REVIEW WEBSITE/AGGREGATOR (max 60):
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Sites like complete-review.com, goodreads.com ‚Üí MAX SCORE 60
‚ö†Ô∏è These are ABOUT reviews or AGGREGATE reviews, not reviews themselves
‚ö†Ô∏è URL patterns: complete-review.com/reviews/*, goodreads.com/book/*
‚ö†Ô∏è Typically just show excerpts or summaries of other reviews

SCHOLARLY BOOK REVIEW (90-100):
‚úì PDF format AND title contains "review"
‚úì Journal domain (.edu, sagepub, oxford, etc.) AND title contains "review"
‚úì Snippet mentions specific pages, chapters, or quotes from the book
```

   - Added language detection rules
   - Added review website detection rules
   - Enhanced secondary scoring criteria

### Frontend:
1. **`index.html`**
   - Added query allocation control UI
   - Added `queryAllocation` state object
   - Added `updateQueryAllocation()` function
   - Added `setQueryPreset()` function
   - Modified query generation to use dynamic allocation
   - Added `addCostSummaryPanel()` function

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: Query Allocation
1. Open Edit Reference modal
2. Change allocation to 6 primary + 2 secondary
3. Click "Suggest Queries"
4. Verify 6 primary-focused and 2 secondary-focused queries generated

### Test Case 2: Cost Tracking
1. Process a reference (query gen + autorank)
2. Check Debug tab for cost panels
3. Verify:
   - Token counts shown per operation
   - Costs calculated correctly ($0.003/1K input, $0.015/1K output)
   - Session totals accumulate
   - Projections appear after processing

### Test Case 3: Language Detection
1. Retest Reference #100 (Zarefsky)
2. Expected: books.google.li scores P:70 or lower (not P:85)
3. Expected: English UChicago Press scores higher

### Test Case 4: Review Website Detection
1. Retest Reference #8 (Hacking)
2. Expected: complete-review.com scores S:60 or lower (not S:95)
3. Expected: Actual SAGE journal review scores S:90+

## Success Metrics

**Goal:** Reduce override rate from 50% (v14.1) to <25% (v14.2)

**v14.1 Results:**
- Reference #8: 1 override (50% success)
- Reference #100: 1 override (50% success)
- Total: 2/4 recommendations accepted (50% override rate)

**v14.2 Expected Improvements:**
- Language detection prevents foreign-language sources from scoring too high
- Review website detection prevents aggregator sites from outranking actual reviews
- Combined with v14.1's content-type detection, should improve accuracy significantly

---

## Cost Analysis

**User-Reported Totals (as of Oct 27, 2025):**
- Claude API: $4.16
- Google API: $84.39
- Combined: $88.55

**Estimated Usage:**
- ~16,878 Google searches
- ~2,110 references processed
- ~$0.042 per reference

**Projection for Remaining 500 References:**

- Claude: ~$10.50
- Total: ~$30.50

**New Total:** ~$119.05

## Next Steps

1. **User Testing:**
   - Test query allocation control with different splits
   - Verify cost tracking accuracy
   - Retest problematic references (#8, #100)

2. **Monitor Override Rate:**
   - Target: <25% override rate
   - Track in session logs
   - Update LOG_ANALYSIS_TRACKER.md

3. **Iterate if Needed:**
   - If override rate still too high, consider v14.3 with:
     - More aggressive domain filtering
     - Fetch and analyze more page content
     - Additional heuristics based on user feedback

**Implementation completed successfully. Ready for production testing.**
