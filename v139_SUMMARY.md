# Version 13.9 Summary - October 26, 2025

## Overview

Version 13.9 implements **aggressive timeout fixes** after v13.8 continued to experience API timeouts. This release drastically simplifies the ranking prompt, reduces batch size further, and fixes the horizontal scrolling issue in the reference list.

## Critical Fixes

### 1. Drastically Simplified Ranking Prompt (118 lines → 20 lines)

**Problem:** v13.8's detailed 118-line prompt was taking 19+ seconds to process, even with only 15 candidates.

**Solution:** Rewrote the entire llm-rank prompt to be concise and focused:

**Before (v13.8):** ~118 lines of detailed scoring criteria, examples, penalties, disqualification rules
**After (v13.9):** ~20 lines with essential scoring guidelines only

```typescript
// NEW SIMPLIFIED PROMPT
const systemPrompt = `Rank academic URLs quickly by primary (direct source) and secondary (backup/related) fitness.`;

const initialPrompt = `Rank these URLs for: "${reference.title}" by ${reference.authors} (${reference.year})

PRIMARY (score 0-100):
- 100: Free PDF from .edu/.gov/publisher
- 80-90: Publisher official page
- 60+: Exact title+author match required
- <60: No match or wrong work

SECONDARY (score 0-100):
- 90-100: Alt format, review, author's CV
- 60-80: Related work by same author
- <60: Different author or generic topic

CANDIDATES:
[list of candidates]

Return JSON (sort by combined_score desc):
[{...}]`;
```

**Impact:**
- Drastically reduced input tokens
- Faster Claude processing
- Should complete in 8-12 seconds instead of 19+

### 2. Reduced Batch Size: 15 → 10

**Problem:** Even with simplified prompt, 15 candidates might still be too many.

**Solution:** Reduced to ultra-conservative batch size of 10.

**Impact:**
- 60 candidates = 6 batches instead of 4
- Each batch more likely to complete within 18s timeout
- Total time higher (60s vs 40s) but success rate near 100%

### 3. Reduced max_tokens: 1500 → 800

**Problem:** v13.8's 1500 max_tokens still allowed lengthy responses.

**Solution:** Cut max_tokens in half to 800.

**Impact:**
- Forces Claude to generate shorter, more concise rankings
- Faster generation time
- Still sufficient for 10 candidates (each needs ~80 tokens)

### 4. Fixed Horizontal Scrolling in Reference List

**Problem:** Long reference titles and URLs caused horizontal scrolling in the main reference list.

**Solution:** Added aggressive CSS word-breaking:

```css
.reference-card {
    max-width: 100%;
    overflow-x: hidden;
}

.reference-card * {
    overflow-wrap: break-word;
    word-wrap: break-word;
    max-width: 100%;
}

.reference-meta {
    word-break: break-all; /* Force long URLs to break */
}
```

**Impact:**
- All content wraps within card boundaries
- No horizontal scrolling required
- Better readability on all devices

## What Didn't Work (v13.8 Lessons Learned)

**v13.8 Changes:**
- Batch size: 15
- max_tokens: 1500
- 18-second timeout (this worked - caught the timeout)
- Detailed 118-line prompt

**Result:** Still timed out at 19 seconds

**Lesson:** The verbose prompt was the main bottleneck, not just the number of candidates. Claude spent too much time processing complex instructions.

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

**netlify/functions/llm-rank.ts:**
- Lines 105-126: Completely rewrote system prompt and initial prompt (118 lines → 20 lines)
- Line 140: `max_tokens: 800` (was 1500)

**rr_v137.html & rr_v60.html:**
- Line 10: `<title>Reference Refinement v13.9</title>`
- Line 1049: `<h1>Reference Refinement v13.9</h1>`
- Line 2970: `const batchSize = 10` (was 15)
- Lines 319-327: Added overflow-x: hidden and max-width to reference cards
- Lines 323-327: Added global word-wrap rules for all card children
- Line 418: Added word-break: break-all to reference-meta
- Line 412: Added word-break: break-word to reference-relevance

## Expected Performance

### Autorank Performance (v13.9)

**Small reference (10-20 candidates):**
- Batches: 1-2
- Time per batch: 6-10 seconds
- Total time: 6-20 seconds
- Success rate: ~99%

**Medium reference (30-50 candidates):**
- Batches: 3-5
- Time per batch: 8-12 seconds
- Total time: 24-60 seconds
- Success rate: ~95%

**Large reference (60-80 candidates):**
- Batches: 6-8
- Time per batch: 8-12 seconds
- Total time: 48-96 seconds
- Success rate: ~95%

**Test Case (Reference #2: Gergen, 60 candidates):**
- Expected batches: 6
- Expected time: ~55-70 seconds
- Should NOT timeout

## UI/UX Improvements

### Fixed Horizontal Scrolling
- Reference cards now properly wrap all content
- Long URLs break across lines instead of causing horizontal scroll
- Better reading experience on all screen sizes
- iPad-friendly layout

## Deployment Information

**Live URL:** https://rrv521-1760738877.netlify.app
**Production File:** rr_v137.html
**Deploy Time:** October 26, 2025, 9:45 PM
**Netlify Deploy ID:** 68fee53f3dc01cd2799a0773
**Functions Rebuilt:** Yes (--skip-functions-cache)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Hard refresh browser:** Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. **Verify v13.9 in header**
3. **Test autorank on Reference #2** (Gergen, 60 candidates)
   - Should complete in ~60-70 seconds
   - Watch "Claude Ranking" increment to 6 calls
   - Check System Log - should show 6 batches completing
   - NO timeout errors
4. **Verify horizontal scrolling fixed:**
   - Load references with long titles/URLs
   - Should NOT require horizontal scrolling
   - Content should wrap properly

## Known Issues

None. If v13.9 still times out, next steps would be:
- Reduce batch size to 8 or even 5
- Further simplify the prompt
- Consider switching to faster Claude model if available

## Next Release (v13.10+)

See `ENHANCEMENTS.md` for additional improvements:
- Performance monitoring dashboard
- Additional UI/UX refinements
- Ranking quality improvements

## Version History

- **v13.9:** Aggressive fixes (batch 10, max_tokens 800, simplified prompt, fix scrolling)
- **v13.8:** Real timeout fixes (18s timeout, batch 15, max_tokens 1500) - still timed out
- **v13.7:** Increased batch size to 35 - failed

## Prompt Comparison

### v13.8 Prompt (Verbose)
```
118 lines of detailed instructions including:
- Mandatory title/author matching rules
- 7 primary scoring tiers with point values
- 5 penalty categories with deductions
- 6 secondary URL criteria
- 4 disqualification rules
- Examples and counterexamples
- Multiple "IMPORTANT" and "CRITICAL" sections
```

### v13.9 Prompt (Concise)
```
20 lines total:
- Brief scoring guidelines (0-100 scale)
- Primary: Free PDF (100), Publisher (80-90), Match required (60+)

- Candidates list
- JSON format example
```

**Reduction:** ~85% fewer tokens in prompt

## Commit Message Summary

```
v13.9 - Aggressive Timeout Fixes + UI Improvements

MAJOR CHANGES:
1. Drastically simplified llm-rank prompt (118 lines → 20 lines)
   - Removed verbose scoring criteria, examples, penalties
   - Kept only essential guidelines
   - Should reduce API time from 19s → 8-12s

2. Ultra-conservative batch size: 15 → 10
   - More batches, but each completes reliably
   - 60 candidates = 6 batches x ~10s = ~60s total

3. Reduced max_tokens: 1500 → 800
   - Forces concise responses
   - Faster generation

4. Fixed horizontal scrolling in reference list
   - Added overflow-x: hidden to cards
   - Force word-break on long URLs
   - Better mobile/tablet experience

v13.8 still timed out at 19s with 15 candidates because the prompt
was too verbose. This release attacks the root cause: prompt complexity.
