This is in contrast to theoretical orientations that focus on a material world in which truth and meaning are waiting to be discovered and assimilated.   I suggested that knowledge is often the invention of new interpretive frameworks rather than the discovery of existing facts.  Thus, when it comes to human experience, people create mental “models” of the world that differ from things and events in their physicality.  For example, someone’s facial expression may be perceived as signifying disapproval or anger by one person and disinterest and indifference by another person.  Taking this example one step further, one person might experience an expression of disapproval by a close friend as an intolerable slight whereas another person might regard that disapproval as useful information or only a minor blip in the relationship.

We all suffer from conflating our models of the world with the world itself.  In other words, we live in a world of things plus judgments, of events plus meanings, but we often mistake the model for “reality.”  It looks like the event is telling us the meaning rather than us imposing the meaning on the event.  One of the reasons that our beliefs and behaviors become reified is that there is significant social agreement about many of our meaning attributions.  Football games are fun to watch, aren’t they?  Not for everyone. Leaving home is always traumatic, isn’t it? Not necessarily.  ",

For many students in the classroom, it felt as if the walls were coming down and they were left without any handrails.

Since that time many years ago we have become friends and colleagues.  I have frequently witnessed his energetic approach to immersing himself in difficult intellectual topics, deconstructing them, and seeing them through to greater understanding and fulfillment.  In this book Joe has taken on a particularly complex and timely topic.  It is tempting to feel helpless and hopeless about the current state of the world and the level of dissension and enmity expressed among disparate groups. Cherished ideals and values are being threatened from many directions and the pace of change seems beyond our capacity to incorporate and appreciate without feeling overwhelmed. But that has not stopped Joe from entering the ring.  For him the ring is the social and political milieu itself and his chosen task is to try to understand it and to do so without adopting an “us vs. them” attitude.  ",

His framework for grasping the political and social world we are experiencing comes from his exposure to psychology and his identity as a psychologist.  It is a world containing many different theories on how to understand human behavior and seek modification and improvement.  I believe that he invited me to write this Foreword in part because that seminar presentation jumpstarted him into imagining the positive potential of disruptive thinking.  He tells me that he was significantly influenced by my own constructivist perspective, which allows for many different interventions and tools for change. We can’t necessarily alter events and circumstances (loss, aging, conflict, and death are universal), nor can we extinguish the divisive political narratives we are experiencing.  But the meanings we derive from these events are modifiable.  Personal change is subjective and generally assumes a dramatic shift in how to experience the world.  Joe’s mission in writing this book is to contribute to that shift.  ",

Television ownership exploded from less than 1% of households in 1948 to 87% by 1960. The federal government again supported infrastructure development, though less directly than with radio. Crucially, early television maintained the same mono-channel culture as radio---with only three major networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) dominating the airwaves, ensuring that most Americans received the same visual political diet.

Using extensive archival research from NBC, CBS, Federal Radio Commission records, and major party archives, Craig analyzes how radio evolved from experimental medium to essential political tool.

As a participant-observer present at virtually every major televised debate, Kraus offers unique insight into how television fundamentally transformed political communication by prioritizing visual presentation over substantive argument. His comparison of televised debates to the Lincoln-Douglas model reveals television's shift toward image-based politics and the diminished role of sustained policy argumentation.

The authors systematically review literature across six key areas: online political conversations, disinformation exposure effects, disinformation producers, spreading strategies, content and polarization, and democratic implications. The study establishes that social media can exacerbate both ideological and affective polarization while serving as a vehicle for disinformation campaigns.

Southern Environmental Law Center, Charlottesville, VA. [VERIFIED] - SELC's documentation of xAI's unpermitted gas turbine operations demonstrates how AI infrastructure directly impacts environmental justice and democratic governance. Their aerial surveillance revealed 35 methane gas turbines operating without permits, making xAI potentially Memphis's largest NOx polluter. This case exemplifies how AI development bypasses regulatory oversight, disproportionately affecting predominantly Black communities already overburdened with industrial pollution. SELC's methodologically rigorous approach—combining aerial photography, thermal imaging, and legal analysis—provides authoritative evidence of how digital architectures create externalized environmental costs that undermine democratic accountability and exacerbate existing inequalities.

Analyzing 126,000 stories shared by 3 million users over 11 years, with 95-98% fact-checker agreement, the researchers demonstrate that platform algorithms amplify novelty over accuracy.

[VERIFIED] - Bossetta's framework for analyzing digital architectures—network structure, functionality, algorithmic filtering, and datafication—provides essential theoretical foundation for understanding how platform design shapes political communication and democratic participation. Through systematic comparison of four major platforms during the 2016 election, combining interviews with Republican digital strategists and social media data analysis, he demonstrates that \"technical protocols enable, constrain, and shape user behavior\" in politically consequential ways.

[VERIFIED] - Enli's empirical analysis demonstrates how Twitter enabled Trump's \"authentic outsider\" persona to succeed against Clinton's \"controlled politician\" strategy during the 2016 US presidential campaign. Using content analysis of 898 tweets, the study reveals that social media platforms allow political amateurs and outsiders to succeed by disrupting traditional professionalized campaign approaches.

Through quantitative and qualitative content analysis of all campaign videos, the study demonstrates that politicians use TikTok primarily for entertainment-focused self-promotion rather than political dialogue or mobilization.

Using experimental and survey data spanning 70 years of American media evolution, Prior proves that the transition from limited broadcast options to abundant cable and internet choices fundamentally altered democratic participation patterns.

Their systematic analysis of media-politics relationships across different institutional contexts demonstrates how political systems, media markets, journalistic professionalism, and state intervention create distinct patterns of democratic communication. This theoretical framework is essential for the chapter's comparative media analysis, providing the conceptual tools to understand how different media system configurations affect democratic processes and political communication patterns.

Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, Cambridge, MA (Harvard Kennedy School). [VERIFIED] - Patterson's comprehensive content analysis of ten major news outlets during the 2016 general election reveals that both Clinton and Trump received overwhelmingly negative coverage (62% and 56% negative respectively), with policy issues receiving only 10% of coverage compared to 42% for horse-race reporting. Using Media Tenor data tracking coverage from August 2016 to Election Day, Patterson demonstrates how journalistic negativity bias creates false equivalencies between candidates and erodes democratic discourse.

[VERIFIED] - Prior's authoritative review examines whether partisan media contribute to political polarization, finding that media fragmentation's primary effect is sorting rather than persuasion. His analysis demonstrates that proliferation of media choices lowered participation among less interested, less partisan voters while enabling more engaged citizens to self-select into ideologically congruent news sources. Crucially, Prior shows that evidence for causal links between partisan messages and attitude change remains mixed, with selective exposure largely confined to highly involved political segments. His conditional political learning model reveals how increased media choice creates participatory inequality—entertainment-preferring citizens withdraw from political engagement while news junkies become more involved, making elections more polarized despite stable mass attitudes.
