# Quick Start - October 27, 2025

## Current State

**Version:** v13.11 (deployed ~10:00 PM Oct 26)
**URL:** https://rrv521-1760738877.netlify.app
**Status:** NOT YET TESTED by user

## What Changed Last Night

**v13.11 - The Nuclear Fix:**
- Switched from JSON to pipe-delimited text format
- Claude returns: `INDEX|PRIMARY|SECONDARY|PRIMARY_REASON|...|RECOMMEND`
- We parse it ourselves into JSON

**Why This Should Work:**
- Timeout already fixed in v13.9 (19s → 11s) ✅
- JSON parsing was the only remaining issue
- Pipe-delimited text is much simpler for Claude than JSON

## First Thing to Test

1. Open: https://rrv521-1760738877.netlify.app
2. Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R
3. Verify header: "Reference Refinement v13.11"
4. Test autorank on Reference #3 (Berger & Luckmann, ~60 candidates)

**Expected Result:**
- ~60 seconds (6 batches × 10s)
- No timeout errors
- No parsing errors
- Successful rankings

**If it fails:**
- Share complete System Log from Debug tab
- Note the error message
- I'll check Netlify function logs for diagnostics

## What We Learned Last Night

1. **Timeout fix (v13.9):** Simplified prompt from 118 → 20 lines = 19s → 11s
2. **JSON is unreliable:** Claude Sonnet 4 can't consistently return pure JSON
3. **Text parsing works:** Structured text is easier for Claude than JSON
4. **Horizontal scrolling fixed:** User confirmed references no longer require scrolling
5. **Don't blame cache:** Focus on functional code fixes, not deployment issues

## Key Files

- `netlify/functions/llm-rank.ts` - Ranking logic (pipe-delimited format)
- `rr_v137.html` - Frontend (batch size 10, version 13.11)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project documentation (current version, known issues)
- `SESSION_END_OCT26.md` - Last night's detailed session notes

## If Autorank Works

Mark it as RESOLVED and move to enhancements:
- Performance monitoring dashboard
- Additional UI improvements
- Quality refinements

## If Autorank Fails

Debug steps:
1. Check what Claude actually returned (diagnostics now log this)
2. Adjust pipe parsing logic if needed
3. May need to tweak prompt format
4. Consider even simpler format (TSV/CSV) as fallback

---

**Bottom Line:** v13.11 has the timeout fix AND a new parsing approach. Should finally work!
