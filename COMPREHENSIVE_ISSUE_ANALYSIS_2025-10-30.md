**Date:** October 31, 2025, 1:45 AM
**Source:** Session log analysis + screenshot + user feedback
**Status:** Analysis complete - Ready for fixes

---

## üìä EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Found **7 distinct issues** across **4 categories**:
1. **Technical Failure** (1 issue) - RID 115 ranking failure
2. **Quality Issues** (3 issues) - Wrong URL selection
3. **Parser Issues** (2 issues) - Bibliography in title
4. **Query Issues** (1 issue) - Poor secondary queries

---

## üî¥ ISSUE 1: RANKING FAILURE (CRITICAL)

### Reference: RID 115
**Title:** "The Digital Architectures of Social Media: Comparing Political Campaigning on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat in the 2016 U.S. Election"
**Author:** Bossetta, M.

### Error Message
```
[10:20:38 PM] Exception: Autorank Failed
Error: fetch failed
```

### Analysis
**NOT a timeout** (would show "AbortError")
**NOT a parse error** (would show parse details)
**IS a network error** (fetch failed)

### Possible Causes
1. **Network connectivity issue** between Netlify and Anthropic API
2. **API endpoint temporarily down**
3. **Request formatting issue** causing fetch to fail
4. **CORS/proxy issue** (unlikely but possible)

### Evidence From Logs
- Queries generated successfully (3 queries)
- Google searches completed (23 results found)
- Ranking started (batch 1/2 with 15 candidates)
- Failed after 12 seconds (10:20:26 ‚Üí 10:20:38)

### Fix Priority
**P0 - CRITICAL**
- Add better error logging to distinguish network vs timeout vs parse errors
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Show user-friendly error message with specific cause

---

## üü° ISSUE 2: QUOTATIONS vs FULL TEXT (QUALITY)

### Reference: RID 3
**Title:** "The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge"
**Author:** Berger, P. L.

### User Feedback
```
"The recommended primary was actually not the full text, but rather quotations from it.
The full title was " PETER BERGER QUOTATIONS ‚Äî THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF REALITY".
Easy mistake. The original secondary was excellent."
```

### What Happened
AI ranked **quotations collection** higher than **full text**:
- ‚ùå Selected: "PETER BERGER QUOTATIONS"
- ‚úÖ Should have selected: Full text of the actual book

### Root Cause
Current ranking criteria (`llm-rank.ts:126-151`) doesn't explicitly exclude:
- "quotations" in title
- "excerpts" in title
- "anthology" in title
- "selections" in title

### Impact
**MEDIUM** - Misleading URL that looks valid but isn't full text

### Fix Priority
**P1 - HIGH**
Add explicit exclusion rules:
```
QUOTATIONS/EXCERPTS/ANTHOLOGIES (max 65):
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: If URL or title contains "quotations", "excerpts",
"anthology", "selections" ‚Üí MAX SCORE 65
```

---

## üü° ISSUE 3: PRIMARY/SECONDARY SWAP (QUALITY)

### Reference: RID 114
**Title:** "The spread of true and false news online"
**Author:** Vosoughi, S.

### User Feedback
```
"RID 114 saw a swap of the suggest secondary and primary urls"
```

### What Happened
AI suggested:
- ‚ùå **Primary:** MIT news article (press release about the study)
- ‚ùå **Secondary:** Science journal article (actual peer-reviewed paper)

Should be:
- ‚úÖ **Primary:** Science journal article (the actual research)
- ‚úÖ **Secondary:** MIT news article (news about the research)

### Root Cause
AI confused "news about research" with "the research itself"

News articles ABOUT research should be:
- LOW primary score (not the work)
- MEDIUM secondary score (analysis/coverage)

### Impact
**MEDIUM** - Reversed primary/secondary

### Fix Priority
**P1 - HIGH**
Add detection for news coverage of research:
```
NEWS ABOUT RESEARCH (PRIMARY: max 55, SECONDARY: 60-75):
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: If news.mit.edu, university press release, or "MIT study shows"
‚ö†Ô∏è This is NEWS ABOUT research, not the research itself
‚ö†Ô∏è Primary score: max 55 (not the source)
‚ö†Ô∏è Secondary score: 60-75 (coverage of the work)
```

---

## üü° ISSUE 4: POOR SECONDARY SELECTION (QUALITY)

### References: RID 106, RID 111
**RID 106:** Davis's "The Web of Politics"
**RID 111:** Tucker's "Social Media, Political Polarization"

### User Feedback (RID 106)
```
"When there is no review, then the subject matter treatment category needs work
because our hit rate on secondaries that are not reviews is poor. Reviews are
well identified when they exist but they do not. In this case there were numerous
candidates with low secondary scores. Time up the subject matter analysis category
of secondary urls and adjust the ranking scores for that type of secondary url,
but don't prioritize subject analyses over reviews."
```

### User Feedback (RID 111)
```
"RID 111 had no secondary suggested, but was not flagged and needing manual review."

"Again, no secondary suggestion. We need to tune up our query and ranking skills
in subject matter analysis when there is no review or analysis of the reference work."
```

### What's Wrong
**Current secondary scoring:**
- Reviews: 90-100 (well identified ‚úÖ)
- Academic discussion: 60-75
- Topic discussion: 40-60

**Problem:** When no review exists, scores are too low (40-75)

**Result:**
- All candidates score <75
- No clear winner
- Either no secondary recommended OR flagged for manual review
- User has to manually select from mediocre options

### User's Insight
"Think of it like primaries having two tiers":
1. **Tier 1 (Full text):** 95-100
2. **Tier 2 (Publisher/seller):** 60-75

**Secondaries should have similar tiers:**
1. **Tier 1 (Reviews):** 90-100
2. **Tier 2 (Subject analysis):** Currently 40-75, should be 75-90

### Impact
**HIGH** - Many references have no reviews, so this affects ~50% of cases

### Fix Priority
**P1 - HIGH**
Adjust secondary scoring:
```
CURRENT:
- Reviews: 90-100
- Academic discussion: 60-75 ‚Üê TOO LOW
- Topic discussion: 40-60 ‚Üê TOO LOW

PROPOSED:
- Reviews: 90-100 (no change)
- Academic discussion: 75-90 ‚Üê INCREASED
- Topic discussion: 60-75 ‚Üê INCREASED
```

## üü¢ ISSUE 5: PARSER ADDS BIBLIOGRAPHY TO TITLE

### References: RID 102, RID 104

### User Feedback (RID 102)
```
"For RID 102 the following bibliographic information was included in the title,
which I have fixed manually here. The bibliographic text was
"  (2nd ed) Routledge, New York/London". Analyze this and enhance the parser."
```

### User Feedback (RID 104)
```
"For RID 104 there was another parsing error the added bibliography information
to the title. I have corrected that reference. The bibliography text that was
included in the title was something like
" Updated Edition, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL""
```

### What's Happening
Parser is including publication info in title field:
- **RID 102 Title:** "Televised Presidential Debates and Public Policy **(2nd ed) Routledge, New York/London**"
- **RID 104 Title:** "News That Matters **Updated Edition, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL**"

### Root Cause
Parser regex or logic is not properly separating:
- Title text
- Edition info
- Publisher info
- Location info

### Current Parser Location
`index.html` line ~1491-1567 (reference parsing logic)

### Impact
**LOW** - Doesn't affect URL selection, just display/formatting
**User can manually fix** - Not blocking

### Fix Priority
**P2 - MEDIUM**
Improve parser to detect and separate:
- Edition markers: "(2nd ed)", "Updated Edition", etc.
- Publisher info after title
- Should go in "other" field, not "title" field

---

## üü¢ ISSUE 6: POOR SECONDARY QUERY GENERATION

### Reference: RID 111
**Title:** "Social Media, Political Polarization, and Political Disinformation"

### User Feedback
```
"The generic domain query at this point seems to be a string of keywords
rather than a sentence. Think deeply about this and update the secondary
subject matter query and ranking."
```

### Example Query (From Log)
```
Query 8: "social media political polarization disinformation democratic processes
algorithmic amplification ideological affective"
```

**This is just a keyword string, not a proper search query!**

### Better Approach
Instead of keyword string, use structured queries:
```
BAD:  "social media political polarization disinformation"
GOOD: "social media effects on political polarization scholarly analysis"
GOOD: "how social media increases political polarization peer-reviewed"
GOOD: "social media polarization mechanisms empirical research"
```

### Impact
**MEDIUM** - Results in poor secondary candidates when no review exists

### Fix Priority
**P1 - HIGH**
Improve query generation for secondary subject matter searches:
1. Use complete sentences/phrases
2. Add qualifiers: "scholarly analysis", "empirical research", "theoretical framework"
3. Target academic discussions, not just keyword matches

---

## üü° ISSUE 7: NO MANUAL_REVIEW FLAG WHEN NO SECONDARY

### Reference: RID 111

### User Feedback
```
"RID 111 had no secondary suggested, but was not flagged and needing manual review."
```

### Expected Behavior
When ranking can't find a good secondary (all scores <75), should:
- ‚úÖ Flag with `FLAGS[MANUAL_REVIEW]`
- ‚úÖ Alert user to manually search for secondary

### Actual Behavior
- ‚ùå No flag added
- ‚ùå Reference appears "complete" but has no secondary URL
- ‚ùå User doesn't know it needs attention

### Root Cause
Manual review flag logic only triggers when:
- No primary URL found with score ‚â•75

Should also trigger when:
- No secondary URL found with score ‚â•75

### Impact
**LOW** - User can see "Secondary: Not set" but not prioritized for review

### Fix Priority
**P2 - MEDIUM**
Add flag when secondary < 75:
```javascript
if (bestSecondary?.secondary_score < 75 || !bestSecondary) {
  ref.needsManualReview = true;
}
```

---

## üìã PRIORITY MATRIX

### P0 - CRITICAL (Fix Immediately)
1. **Ranking Failure (RID 115)** - Network error handling and retry

### P1 - HIGH (Fix Soon)
2. **Quotations/Excerpts Detection** - Add explicit exclusions
3. **Primary/Secondary Swap** - Detect news about research
4. **Poor Secondary Selection** - Adjust score ranges
5. **Secondary Query Generation** - Use sentences not keywords

### P2 - MEDIUM (Fix When Possible)
6. **Parser Bibliography in Title** - Improve title extraction
7. **No Manual Review Flag** - Flag missing secondaries

---

## üîß RECOMMENDED FIXES

### Fix 1: Better Error Logging (P0)
**File:** `index.html` line 3551-3555
**Change:** Add detailed error information to Debug panel

```javascript
catch (error) {
    const errorMsg = error.message || error.toString();
    const errorType = error.name || 'Unknown';

    let debugInfo = `<strong>Error Type:</strong> ${errorType}\n`;
    debugInfo += `<strong>Error Message:</strong> ${errorMsg}\n`;

    if (error.stack) {
        debugInfo += `\n<strong>Stack Trace:</strong>\n${error.stack.substring(0, 500)}`;
    }

    this.addDebugPanel('Exception: Autorank Failed', debugInfo, 'error');

    // Specific error message based on type
    if (errorMsg.includes('fetch failed') || errorMsg.includes('network')) {
        this.showToast('Network error during ranking. Check connection and retry.', 'error');
    } else if (errorMsg.includes('timeout') || errorMsg.includes('abort')) {
        this.showToast('Ranking timeout. Try with fewer candidates or simpler queries.', 'error');
    } else {
        this.showToast('Ranking failed. Check Debug tab (Tab 3) for details.', 'error');
    }
}
```

### Fix 2: Add Quotations/Excerpts Detection (P1)
**File:** `llm-rank.ts` line 126 (after full-text indicators)
**Add:**

```
QUOTATIONS/EXCERPTS/ANTHOLOGIES (max 65):
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: If title or URL contains "quotations", "excerpts", "anthology", "selections", "reader" ‚Üí MAX SCORE 65
‚ö†Ô∏è These are PARTIAL collections, not complete works
‚ö†Ô∏è Example: "Peter Berger Quotations" ‚â† Full text of Berger's work
‚ö†Ô∏è Example: "Readings in..." or "Selected Works" ‚â† Complete book
‚ö†Ô∏è Even from .edu or as PDF, partial content scores lower than full text
```

### Fix 3: Detect News About Research (P1)
**File:** `llm-rank.ts` line 146 (in review/about section)
**Add:**

```
NEWS ABOUT RESEARCH (PRIMARY: max 55, SECONDARY: 60-75):
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: If news.mit.edu, sciencedaily.com, phys.org, university press release
‚ö†Ô∏è Or if snippet contains "study shows", "researchers found", "according to research"
‚ö†Ô∏è These are NEWS REPORTS about research, not the research itself
‚ö†Ô∏è The actual journal article is the primary source
‚ö†Ô∏è PRIMARY score: max 55 (this is coverage, not the source)
‚ö†Ô∏è SECONDARY score: 60-75 (valid as news coverage of the work)
```

### Fix 4: Adjust Secondary Scoring (P1)
**File:** `llm-rank.ts` lines 189-204
**Change:**

```
BEFORE:
ACADEMIC DISCUSSION (60-75):
‚Ä¢ Paper that cites/discusses the work
‚Ä¢ Not explicitly a review but analyzes themes
‚Ä¢ Work-focused content

TOPIC DISCUSSION (40-60):
‚Ä¢ Discusses concepts from the work
‚Ä¢ No specific work reference or review

AFTER:
ACADEMIC DISCUSSION (75-90):  ‚Üê INCREASED
‚Ä¢ Paper that cites/discusses the work substantively
‚Ä¢ Analyzes themes, applications, or implications
‚Ä¢ Scholarly treatment of the work's concepts
‚Ä¢ Not a review but still work-focused analysis

TOPIC DISCUSSION (60-75):  ‚Üê INCREASED
‚Ä¢ Discusses broader concepts from the work
‚Ä¢ Contextualizes within field or literature
‚Ä¢ Thematic exploration including this work
‚Ä¢ Not specific to this work but relevant
```

### Fix 5: Improve Secondary Query Generation (P1)
**File:** `index.html` or `llm-chat.ts` (query generation)
**Change:** Improve final "topic discussion" query

```
BEFORE (Query 8):
"social media political polarization disinformation democratic processes algorithmic amplification"

AFTER (Query 8):
"scholarly analysis of social media effects on political polarization and democratic processes"
OR
"empirical research on social media polarization mechanisms peer-reviewed"
OR
"theoretical frameworks explaining social media political effects academic"
```

**Implementation:** Modify query generation prompt to create proper phrases for Query 8 instead of keyword strings

### Fix 6: Improve Parser (P2)
**File:** `index.html` line ~1491-1567
**Analysis Needed:** Review parser logic to separate title from edition/publisher info

**Pattern to detect:**
- `(2nd ed)`, `(Updated Edition)`, `(Revised)` ‚Üí Goes to "other" field
- After detecting edition, everything after ‚Üí Goes to "other" field
- Title should end before edition markers

### Fix 7: Add Manual Review Flag for Missing Secondary (P2)
**File:** `index.html` line ~3500 (after ranking completes)
**Add:**

```javascript
// Check if secondary score is too low
if (!bestSecondary || bestSecondary.secondary_score < 75) {
    ref.needsManualReview = true;
    this.addDebugLog(`‚ö†Ô∏è No strong secondary URL found (best score: ${bestSecondary?.secondary_score || 0}). Flagged for manual review.`);
}
```
