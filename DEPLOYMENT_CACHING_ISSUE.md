# Critical Deployment & Caching Issue - October 26, 2025

## Problem Summary

**Issue:** Netlify Edge CDN was aggressively caching v13.4 and serving stale content even after deploying v13.7 to production.

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Root cause identified and fixed

**Root Cause:** Netlify Edge cached the redirect/rewrite from `/` to `/rr_v60.html` and continued serving that cached response (age: 2386 seconds) even after new deployments.

**Solution:** Renamed production file to `rr_v137.html` (never cached by CDN) and updated netlify.toml redirect target. Edge cache refreshed on next deployment.

---

## What We Were Trying to Fix

### Original Problem: Autorank 504 Timeouts

**Symptoms:**
- Autorank consistently failing with HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout errors
- Timeouts occurring at exactly 26-29 seconds
- Happening even with small batch sizes (20-25 candidates)

**Timeline of Timeout Fixes:**
- v13.3: Reduced batch size from 50 → 35 (still timed out at 28s)
- v13.4: Reduced batch size from 35 → 25 (still timed out at 29s)
- v13.5: Reduced batch size from 25 → 20 (still timed out at 29s)

**Root Cause Discovery (v13.6):**
The issue was NOT batch size - it was the `search_web` tool in `llm-rank.ts`:

```typescript
// OLD CODE (line 101)
const disableSearch = candidates.length >= 50;
```

When frontend sends batches of 20-35 candidates, the function saw this as "small" and enabled the search_web tool. Claude would then attempt additional web searches during ranking, causing 29-second delays that exceeded the 26-second Netlify timeout limit.

**The Fix:**
```typescript
// NEW CODE (v13.6)
const disableSearch = true;  // Always disable search tool
```

Reasoning: We already perform 8 comprehensive queries upfront in the UI. Additional searches during ranking are unnecessary and were causing timeouts.

**Expected Results:**
- v13.6/v13.7: Ranking should complete in 8-15 seconds (no more timeouts)
- v13.7: Increased batch size back to 35 for better performance

## Deployment Attempts Made

### Multiple Deployments to Netlify

1. **v13.5** (batch size 20)
   - Deploy time: ~4:36 PM
   - Git commit: NOT committed initially
   - Unique deploy URL: `https://68fea126d2d2de5946ddfaa1--rrv521-1760738877.netlify.app`

2. **v13.6** (search tool disabled, batch size 20)
   - Deploy time: ~4:40 PM
   - Git commit: NOT committed initially
   - Unique deploy URL: `https://68fea3212f47e99db16044b5--rrv521-1760738877.netlify.app`

3. **v13.6** (redeployed after git commit)
   - Deploy time: ~4:58 PM
   - Git commit: `6379ab3`
   - Unique deploy URL: `https://68fea7771cad5b501be8cfce--rrv521-1760738877.netlify.app`

4. **v13.6** (with --skip-functions-cache)
   - Deploy time: ~5:00 PM
   - Forced function rebuild
   - Unique deploy URL: `https://68fea784366de65dbf09ecaf--rrv521-1760738877.netlify.app`
   - **Verified via curl:** Returns v13.6 correctly

5. **v13.7** (batch size increased to 35)
   - Deploy time: ~5:08 PM
   - Git commit: `2466e7d`
   - Unique deploy URL: `https://68fea9e46ac664553caef88e--rrv521-1760738877.netlify.app`
   - **Verified via curl:** Returns v13.7 correctly

### Verification Commands Show Correct Deployment

```bash
# Curl verification of latest deploy
curl -s "https://68fea9e46ac664553caef88e--rrv521-1760738877.netlify.app/rr_v60.html" | grep "<title>"
# RETURNS: <title>Reference Refinement v13.7</title>

# Production URL also returns v13.7
curl -s "https://rrv521-1760738877.netlify.app/rr_v60.html" | grep "<title>"
# RETURNS: <title>Reference Refinement v13.7</title>
```

**Conclusion:** Server-side deployment is working correctly. This is purely a client-side caching issue.

## Cache Clearing Attempts Made

### On iPad Safari

User attempted multiple cache clearing methods:

1. **Safari Settings → Clear History and Website Data**
   - Result: Still shows v13.4

2. **Hard refresh attempts**
   - Tried multiple times
   - Result: Still shows v13.4

3. **Closed all Safari tabs and reopened**
   - Result: Still shows v13.4

4. **Used unique deploy URLs** (never accessed before)
   - Example: `https://68fea9e46ac664553caef88e--rrv521-1760738877.netlify.app/rr_v60.html`
   - Screenshot shows this exact URL in address bar
   - Result: **STILL shows v13.4** (see screenshot from 5:09 PM)

5. **Settings → Safari → Advanced → Website Data → Remove All**
   - User attempted this
   - Result: Still shows v13.4

### What Didn't Work

- Cache-control headers are already set in HTML:
  ```html
  <meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate">
  <meta http-equiv="Pragma" content="no-cache">
  <meta http-equiv="Expires" content="0">
  ```

- Netlify cache headers:
  ```
  cache-control: public,max-age=0,must-revalidate
  ```

- Multiple unique deploy URLs (should bypass CDN entirely)

---

## Evidence

### Screenshot Evidence

1. **Reference Refinement v13.7.png** (5:10 PM)
   - Shows v13.4 displayed on iPad
   - URL bar shows: `rv521-1760738877.netlify.app`
   - Empty reference list (Dropbox not connected)

2. **Screenshot 2025-10-26 at 5.09.39 PM.png**
   - Shows unique deploy URL in address bar: `https://68fea9e46ac664553caef88e--rrv521-1760738877.netlify.app`
   - Safari favorites menu is open
   - This URL was NEVER accessed before (brand new deploy)
   - **Still shows v13.4**

### Git Commit History

```bash
6379ab3 v13.6 - Fix autorank timeouts by disabling search tool
8eea2b6 Security: Remove exposed Dropbox App Secret from documentation
7417214 v13.4 - Reduce Batch Size to 25 (35 still timing out)
3338af1 v13.3 - Fix Autorank Timeout (Reduce Batch Size 50→35)
```

## Theories for Next Session

### Possible Causes

1. **iPad Safari Disk Cache**
   - Safari may have a separate disk cache that survives "Clear History and Website Data"
   - May require iPad restart or more aggressive clearing

2. **Service Worker Interference**
   - Checked: No service workers registered in the app
   - Not the issue

3. **iOS Safari Bug**
   - Known issues with Safari aggressively caching SPAs
   - May require iOS settings changes

4. **Network-Level Caching**
   - ISP or network proxy caching
   - Less likely since unique deploy URLs should bypass this

5. **Safari Profile/Session Corruption**
   - Safari may have corrupted profile data
   - May require Safari reset or new browser

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Test on Different Browser**
   - Try Chrome on iPad to confirm server deployment is working
   - If Chrome shows v13.7, confirms Safari-specific issue

2. **Test on Different Device**
   - Access from Mac/desktop to confirm deployment
   - Confirms fix is working, isolates iPad as issue

3. **iPad Nuclear Options**
   - Settings → Safari → Advanced → Experimental Features (check for caching settings)
   - Settings → General → iPad Storage → Safari → Delete App (reinstall Safari)
   - Full iPad restart (power off, wait, power on)
   - Last resort: Reset all settings (Settings → General → Reset)

4. **Alternative URL Strategies**
   - Try adding cache-busting query parameter: `?v=13.7&t=timestamp`
   - Rename HTML file from `rr_v60.html` to `rr_v137.html` (forces new URL)
   - Create new Netlify site with different domain

5. **Verify Fix Works (Once Cache Cleared)**
   - Test autorank on Reference #3 (Berger & Luckmann, 66 candidates)
   - Should complete in ~15 seconds without timeout
   - Test Reference #4 (Kahneman, 76 candidates)
   - Should complete in ~18 seconds without timeout

---

## Session Context

### What User Was Testing

User had two references they were attempting to rank:

1. **Reference #3:** Berger & Luckmann (1966) - Social Construction of Reality
   - 66 unique candidates found
   - 3 batches needed (batch size 25 in v13.4)
   - Was timing out in batch 1

2. **Reference #4:** Kahneman (2011) - Thinking, Fast and Slow
   - 76 unique candidates found
   - 4 batches needed (batch size 25 in v13.4)
   - Was timing out in batch 1

### Session Logs

Latest session log: `/Apps/Reference Refinement/debug_logs/session_2025-10-26T22-35-44.txt`

Shows consistent 504 timeouts at ~29 seconds for all autorank attempts.

---

## Important Notes for Next Session

1. **The fix is deployed and working** - verified via curl from command line
2. **This is purely a client-side caching issue** - not a deployment problem
3. **Priority should be:** Get iPad to load v13.7, THEN test if autorank works
4. **If iPad cache won't clear:** Use different browser/device to verify fix works
5. **Once verified working:** Can investigate permanent solution to iPad caching

---

## Questions to Answer Next Session

1. Does the timeout fix actually work? (Can't test until cache cleared)
2. Is batch size 35 safe, or do we need to reduce to 30?
3. Should we implement cache-busting query parameters permanently?
4. Should we rename the HTML file to force cache invalidation?
5. Is there an iPad Safari setting we're missing?

---

## Files to Review Next Session

- `/netlify/functions/llm-rank.ts` - Verify search tool still disabled
- `/rr_v60.html` - Check version number and batch size
- Session logs after successful cache clear - Verify no more 504 errors

## ✅ RESOLUTION (7:00 PM, October 26, 2025)

### The Actual Problem

This was **NOT** a browser cache issue. It was a **Netlify Edge CDN caching issue**.

**Evidence:**
```bash
curl -I https://rrv521-1760738877.netlify.app/
# Returned:
# cache-status: "Netlify Edge"; hit
# age: 2386  # <-- Response cached for 40 minutes!
# HTTP/2 200
# content-length: 176672  # <-- Serving rr_v60.html (v13.4)
```

Even though netlify.toml said to serve rr_v60.html, and rr_v60.html contained v13.7, **Netlify Edge had cached the entire file response** from before the v13.7 deployment.

### Why File Renaming Fixed It

When we:
1. Renamed production file to `rr_v137.html`
2. Updated netlify.toml redirect from `/rr_v60.html` → `/rr_v137.html`
3. Deployed

Netlify Edge cache behavior:
- Old path `/rr_v60.html`: Cached response with v13.4 content
- New path `/rr_v137.html`: **Never cached**, forces fresh fetch
- Result: Edge cache refreshed (`age: 1`) and served v13.7

### Why Browser Cache Still Shows v13.4

Browsers (Safari) cached the **redirect itself** from `/` to `/rr_v60.html`. Even though Netlify now redirects to `/rr_v137.html`, Safari doesn't know this because it cached the old redirect.

**Solutions for users:**
1. Clear Safari cache (Settings → Clear History and Website Data)
2. Access direct URL: `https://rrv521-1760738877.netlify.app/rr_v137.html`
3. Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)

### Key Learnings

1. **Netlify Edge caching is aggressive** - Even with `max-age=0`, edge nodes cache responses
2. **Rewrites (status=200) are cached differently than redirects (status=301)** - Both get cached, but rewrites cache the file content
3. **File renaming bypasses ALL caches** - Most reliable way to force fresh content
4. **Browser vs CDN cache are separate layers** - Fixing CDN doesn't fix browser cache

### Future Prevention

If this happens again:
1. Increment filename (e.g., rr_v137.html → rr_v138.html)
2. Update netlify.toml redirect
3. Deploy
4. Instruct users to access new direct URL or clear cache

**Alternative:** Use query parameters for cache busting (e.g., `?v=13.7&t=timestamp`), but this is less reliable than filename changes.

**Session ended:** 7:00 PM, October 26, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Issue resolved, v13.7 now accessible at /rr_v137.html
**Next action:** Test autorank timeout fix on References #3 and #4
